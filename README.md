Python Programming Assignment

This is an example of a recursive approach to the Floyd Warshall algorithm that was devised from an iterative solution.

Getting Started:

Please install necessary packages that can be found in requirements.txt.
Install the requirements .txt file by entering the following into your shell/command line terminal: pip install -r requirements.txt.

To execute the code: change the directory to src folder and  excecute then following:

$ ./floyd.resursive_final

$ ./floyd.imperative_final


Tests:

This code runs performances tests using Python's timeit function in the floyd_imperative_final and floyd_resursive_final source code files.
A separate unit test file has been included to test the recursive version of the algorithm.
